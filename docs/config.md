# Configuration

Jekyll gives you a lot of flexibility to customize how it builds your site. These options can either be specified in a  `_config.yml`  or  `_config.toml`  file placed in your site’s root directory, or can be specified as flags for the  `jekyll`  executable in the terminal.

### Example Usage
```yml
kramdown:
  html_to_native: true
```

##### There are two unsupported kramdown options

Please note that both  `remove_block_html_tags`  and  `remove_span_html_tags`  are currently unsupported in Jekyll due to the fact that they are not included within the kramdown HTML converter.

For more details about these options have a look at the  [Kramdown configuration documentation](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/options.html).

### CommonMark

[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)  is a rationalized version of Markdown syntax, implemented in C and thus faster than default Kramdown implemented in Ruby. It  [slightly differs](https://github.com/commonmark/CommonMark#differences-from-original-markdown)  from original Markdown and does not support all the syntax elements implemented in Kramdown, like  [Block Inline Attribute Lists](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#block-ials).

It comes in two flavors: basic CommonMark with  [jekyll-commonmark](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-commonmark)  plugin and  [GitHub Flavored Markdown supported by GitHub Pages](https://github.com/github/jekyll-commonmark-ghpages).

## Liquid Options

Liquid’s response to errors can be configured by setting  `error_mode`. The options are

-   `lax`  — Ignore all errors.
-   `warn`  — Output a warning on the console for each error. (default)
-   `strict`  — Output an error message and stop the build.

Within `_config.yml`, the default configuration is as follows:

```yml
liquid:
  error_mode: warn

```

The above example depicts the “warn” value, which is already set by default-  `error_mode: warn`. This results in any issues being called out during the build process however will continue to build if possible.

You can also configure Liquid’s renderer to catch non-assigned variables and non-existing filters by setting  `strict_variables`  and / or  `strict_filters`  to  `true`  respectively.  3.8.0

Do note that while  `error_mode`  configures Liquid’s parser, the  `strict_variables`  and  `strict_filters`  options configure Liquid’s renderer and are consequently orthogonal.

An example of setting these variables within `_config.yml` is as follows:

```yml
liquid:
  error_mode: strict
  strict_variables: true
  strict_filters: true

```

Configuring as described above will stop your build/serve from happening and call out the offending error and halt. This is helpful when desiring to catch liquid-related issues by stopping the build or serve process and allowing you to deal with any issues.

## WEBrick Options

You can provide custom headers for your site by adding them to  `_config.yml`

```yml
# File: _config.yml
webrick:
  headers:
    My-Header: My-Value
    My-Other-Header: My-Other-Value

```

### Defaults

Jekyll provides by default  `Content-Type`  and  `Cache-Control`  response headers: one dynamic in order to specify the nature of the data being served, the other static in order to disable caching so that you don’t have to fight with Chrome’s aggressive caching when you are in development mode.
