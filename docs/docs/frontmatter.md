# Front Matter

Any file that contains a  [YAML](https://yaml.org/)  front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. Here is a basic example:

```
---
layout: post
title: Blogging Like a Hacker
---

```

Between these triple-dashed lines, you can set predefined variables (see below for a reference) or even create custom ones of your own. These variables will then be available for you to access using Liquid tags both further down in the file and also in any layouts or includes that the page or post in question relies on.

## Predefined Global Variables

There are a number of predefined global variables that you can set in the front matter of a page or post.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Variable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>layout</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          If set, this specifies the layout file to use. Use the layout file
          name without the file extension. Layout files must be placed in the
          <code>_layouts</code> directory.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>permalink</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          If you need your processed blog post URLs to be something other than
          the site-wide style (default <code>/year/month/day/title.html</code>), then you can set
          this variable and it will be used as the final URL.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>published</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Set to false if you donâ€™t want a specific post to show up when the
          site is generated.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Custom Variables

You can also set your own front matter variables you can access in Liquid. For instance, if you set a variable called  `food`, you can use that in your page:

```
---
food: Pizza
---

<h1>{{ page.food }}</h1>

```

## Predefined Variables for Posts

These are available out-of-the-box to be used in the front matter for a post.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Variable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>date</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          A date here overrides the date from the name of the post. This can be
          used to ensure correct sorting of posts. A date is specified in the
          format <code>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT</code>; hours, minutes, seconds, and timezone offset
          are optional.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>category</code></p>
        <p><code>categories</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Instead of placing posts inside of folders, you can specify one or
          more categories that the post belongs to. When the site is generated
          the post will act as though it had been set with these categories
          normally. Categories (plural key) can be specified as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Basic_components">YAML list</a> or a
          space-separated string.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>tags</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Similar to categories, one or multiple tags can be added to a post.
          Also like categories, tags can be specified as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Basic_components">YAML list</a> or a
          space-separated string.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

##### Don't repeat yourself

If you don't want to repeat your frequently used front matter variables over and over, define  [defaults](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/front-matter-defaults/ "Front Matter defaults")  for them and only override them where necessary (or not at all). This works both for predefined and custom variables.
